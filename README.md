# TemplVsMLData

## Introduction

Does a data-driven approach, rather than a template-based approach, produces more natural text? 

The two systems, one for the template-based approach and one data-drinven one (seq2seq) are described in detail at: https://projects.cs.uct.ac.za/honsproj/cgi-bin/view/2019/dunn_poulter.zip/

## Funding
In theory, yes, since it was specified as part of the "Quest: Querying Smart Text" project that was approved for funding in 2019 by SADiLaR, but they still haven't paid. The insights gained are also relevant within the scope of the MoreNL project [http://www.meteck.org/MoReNL/] for surface realisers for African languages.
