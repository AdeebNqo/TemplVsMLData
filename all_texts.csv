27	T28	TH28	H	"Temple grandin (born august 29 1947) is an american professor of animal science at colorado state university consultant to the livestock industry on animal behavior and autism spokesperson. She is one of the first individuals on the autism spectrum to publicly share insights from her personal experience of autism. She invented the "" hug box "" device to calm those on the autism spectrum. She was the subject of the award-winning semi-biographical film temple grandin. Temple grandin was born in boston massachusetts into a wealthy family. Although raised in the episcopal religion temple grandin early on gave up on a belief in a personal deity or intention in favor of what she considers a more scientific idea of god. Contrary to widely published reports grandin was never formally diagnosed with autism in childhood or in youth. When grandin was in her mid-teens her mother chanced upon a checklist on autism published by dr. bernard rimland a renowned american psychologist and founder of the autism research institute. Completing the checklist grandin's mother hypothesised that grandin's symptoms were best explained by autism. The medical advice at the time for a diagnosis of autism was to recommend institutionalization a measure that caused a bitter rift of opinion between grandin's parents. Following her expulsion from beaver country day school (reports vary on the actual name of the school grandin was expelled from with grandin herself noting it to be cherry falls girls ' school in her first book emergence : labelled autistic) grandin's mother placed her in mountain country school (now known as hampshire country school) a private boarding school in rindge, new hampshire for children with behavioral problems. It was here that grandin met william carlock a science teacher who had worked for nasa who would become her mentor and help significantly towards building up her self-confidence. For example when grandin was facing criticism for her ' squeeze machine ' at franklin pierce university it was carlock who suggested that grandin undertake scientific experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the device. After she graduated in 1966 from hampshire country school grandin went on to earn her bachelor's degree in human psychology from franklin pierce university in 1970 a master's degree in animal science from arizona state university in 1975 and a doctoral degree in animal science from the university of illinois at urbana–champaign in 1989. She is also internationally famous as a spokesperson on autism. Steve silberman in his book neurotribes wrote that temple grandin helped break down years of shame and stigma because she was one of the first adults to publicly disclose that she was autistic. Bernard rimland a father of a son with autism and author of the book infantile autism wrote the foreword to grandin's first book emergence : labeled autistic. Dr. rimland wrote "" temple's ability to convey to the reader her innermost feelings and fears coupled with her capacity for explaining mental processes will give the reader an insight into autism that very few have been able to achieve . "" When her book thinking in pictures was written in 1995 grandin thought that all individuals with autism thought in photographic specific images the way she did. When the expanded edition was published in 2006 she now realized that it had been wrong to assume that every person with autism processed information the same way she did. In one of her newer books the autistic brain : thinking across the spectrum the concept of three different types of thinking in autism is further developed. An influential book which helped her develop her concept of pattern thinking was clara claiborne park's book titled exiting nirvana : a daughter's life with autism. Grandin expanded on these theories in her book animals make us human. In her academic work as a professor at colorado state university her graduate student bridgett voisinet conducted one of the early studies that showed that cattle that remained calm during handling had higher weight gains. The paper is titled "" feedlot cattle with calm temperaments have higher average daily gains than cattle with excitable temperaments "" published in the journal of animal science vol. Another important paper published by grandin was "" assessment of stress during handling and transport "" journal of animal science 1997 vol. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals ' reality from their viewpoint that when she holds an animal's head in her hands as it is being slaughtered she feels a deep godlike connection to them. She compares the properties and rights of owning cows versus owning screwdrivers enumerating how both may be used to serve human purposes in many ways but when it comes to inflicting pain there is a vital distinction between such "" properties "" legally a person can smash or grind up a screwdriver but cannot torture an animal. She first spoke in public about autism in the mid-1980s at the request of ruth c. sullivan one of the founders of the autism society of america (asa). I learned her name was temple grandin. It wasn 't until later in the week that i realized she was someone with autism. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community. Based on personal experience grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions. As a partial proponent of neurodiversity grandin does not support eliminating autism genes or treating mildly autistic individuals. By contrast jonathan mitchell describes grandin as making generalizations about autistic people saying that many autistics aren 't visual thinkers and that her generalizations trivialize the difficulties associated with autism. The autism activist amy sequenzia has criticized temple grandin for only focusing on and listening to high-functioning autistics as opposed to low-functioning and non-speaking autistics. In 2012 when the american beef industry was struggling with public perception of its use and sale of pink slime grandin spoke out in support of the food product. Beyond her work in animal science and welfare and autism rights her interests include horse riding science fiction movies and biochemistry. She has noted in her autobiographical works that autism affects every aspect of her life. In 2011 she received a double helix medal. She has received honorary degrees from many universities including carnegie mellon university in the united states (2012) mcgill university in canada (1999) and the swedish university of agricultural sciences (2009) and emory university (2016). In 2016 grandin was inducted into the american academy of arts and sciences. In 2012 grandin was interviewed on thriving canine radio to discuss "" a different perspective on animal behavior "". Grandin is the focus of a semi-biographical hbo film titled temple grandin starring claire danes as grandin.

51	T52	TH52	H	"The yongzheng emperor (13 december 1678 – 8 october 1735) born yongzheng emperor was the fifth emperor of china of the manchu people A hard-working ruler the yongzheng emperor's main goal was to create an effective government at minimal expense. Like his father the kangxi emperor the yongzheng emperor used military force to preserve the dynasty's position. Although the yongzheng emperor's reign was much shorter than that of both his father (the kangxi emperor) and his son (the qianlong emperor) the yongzheng era was a period of peace and prosperity. The yongzheng emperor cracked down on corruption and reformed the financial administration. His reign saw the formation of the grand council an institution which had an enormous impact on the future of the qing dynasty. Curplewas the eleventh recorded son of the kangxi emperor and the fourth prince to survive into adulthood. His mother historically known as empress xiaogongren was originally a court attendant from the manchu uya clan. For most of his childhood yinzhen was raised by noble consort tong the daughter of tong guowei the kangxi emperor's maternal uncle and an eminent official in the early part of the kangxi emperor's reign. The kangxi emperor did not raise his children only inside the palace. Yinzhen accompanied his father on several inspection trips around the beijing area as well as one further south. In 1709 the kangxi emperor stripped his second son yunreng of his position as crown prince. Yinreng had been the crown prince for his whole life his removal left the position of heir open to competition among the emperor's remaining sons (the kangxi emperor had 24 sons who reached adulthood). In the same year the kangxi emperor promoted yinzhen from junwang to qinwang (first-rank prince) under the title "" prince yong of the first rank "" (manchu : hošoi hūwaliyasun cin wang). To appoint a new heir the kangxi emperor decreed that officials in his imperial court would nominate a new crown prince. The kangxi emperor's eighth son yunsi was the candidate preferred by the majority of the court as well as many of the kangxi emperor's other sons. The kangxi emperor however opted not to appoint yinsi as his heir apparent largely due to apprehension that yinsi's political clout at court was beginning to overshadow that of himself. Yinzhen (胤 禛 : 13 december 1678 - 08 october 1735 ce) had the highest honor to orchestrate the imperial ceremonies and rituals during the reign of the kangxi emperor which illustrated that yinzhen was well acquainted with the confucianism traditions and customs. As the yongzheng emperor (雍 正 : r . 1723 ce - 1735 ce) of qing dynasty china yinzhen was indubitably a very diplomatically inclined ruler who created an institution of a "" moral government "" based on the confucian principles. A notable quote from yinzhen captured during his reign as the yongzheng emperor in the 1720's expresses his imperial will : "" 小 事 小 料 理 不 可 因 小 而 忽 之 · 大 事 大 振 作 不 可 因 難 處 而 隱 諱 。 朕 意 若 果 能 如 此 實 心 奉 行 以 忠 正 一 字 感 化 不 數 年 賊 亦 人 也 。 見 文 武 大 臣 實 心 忠 勇 為 國 屬 員 清 正 愛 民 營 伍 整 齊 士 卒 曉 勇 而 百 姓 不 懷 如 是 德 不 畏 如 是 威 仍 去 成 群 為 匪 者 朕 想 必 無 此 理 也 。 "" [ page 190 line 7 - line 10 ] "" if it is a trivial matter do not just simply neglect the issue because it seems insignificant. Perhaps the yongzheng era (雍 正 : r . 1723 ce - 1735 ce) may have been overshadowed by his predecessor's accomplishments the kangxi emperor emperor and his achievements may not have been as glorious as his successor the qianlong emperor emperor however the yongzheng era did serve as a remediation to the people and resentments began to gradually whittle. Hence the yongzheng era was a peaceful and prosperous reign of qing dynasty china. In 1712 the kangxi emperor deposed yunreng again and chose not to designate an heir apparent for the remaining years of his reign. Those considered ' frontrunners ' were yunzhi, prince zhi yunsi and yunti, prince xun (the third eighth and 14th princes respectively). Yinzhen had supported yinreng as heir and did not build a large political base for himself until the final years of the kangxi emperor's reign. When the kangxi emperor died in december 1722 the field of contenders shrank to three princes after yinsi pledged his support to the 14th prince yinti. At the time of the kangxi emperor's death yinti who held the appointment of border-pacification general-in-chief was leading a military campaign in northwestern china. Some historians believe that yinti's appointment implied that the kangxi emperor favoured yinti and was grooming him for succession by sending him on a campaign to train him in military affairs. Others however maintain that the kangxi emperor intended to keep yinti away from the capital to ensure a peaceful succession for yinzhen. Official court records state that on 20 december 1722 the ailing kangxi emperor called seven of his sons and the general commandant of the beijing gendarmerie longkodo to his bedside. Longkodo read the will and declared that yinzhen would be the kangxi emperor's successor. There is a widely circulated legend persisting even to the present day that yinzhen was crowned emperor after he modified kangxi emperor's final will that detailed who will succeed him. There are two versions of the legend both of which involves the chinese character "" 十 "" and by extension yunti, prince xun. In this case the will mentions "" prince yong emperor's fourth son yinzhen "" as well as kangxi emperor's high regards for yinzhen and his belief that yinzhen can succeed on the throne. Immediately after succeeding to the throne the yongzheng emperor chose his new governing council. It consisted of the eighth prince yunsi 13th prince yinxiang (prince) zhang tingyu ma qi and longkodo. The nature of his succession remained a subject of controversy and overshadowed the yongzheng emperor's reign. As many of his surviving brothers did not see his succession as legitimate the yongzheng emperor became increasingly paranoid that they would plot to overthrow him. The earlier players in the battle for succession yunzhi, prince zhi the eldest and yinreng the former crown prince continued to live under house arrest. Yinreng died two years after the yongzheng emperor's reign began. The yongzheng emperor continued to perceive yinsi and his party consisting of the princes yuntang yun'e yunti, prince xun and their associates as his greatest political challenge in the early years of his reign. To diffuse their political clout the yongzheng emperor undertook a ' divide and conquer ' strategy. Yinsi was also then appointed as the minister of the lifan yuan (feudatory affairs office) and the top-ranking member of the imperial council assisting the yongzheng emperor some historians believe his position at the time was essentially that of a "" chancellor or prime minister "". By ostensibly elevating yinsi to a more prominent political role the yongzheng emperor held yinsi under close watch and kept him busy with affairs of state reducing the chance of him conducting behind-the-scenes political maneuvers. Yintang was sent to qinghai under the pretext of military service but in reality was watched over by the yongzheng emperor's trusted protégé nian gengyao. Yin 'e the tenth prince was told to leave the capital to send off a departing mongol prince but since he refused to complete this trip as the emperor commanded the yongzheng emperor stripped him of all his titles in may 1724 and sent him north to shunyi to languish in solitude. The 14th prince yinti born to the same mother as the yongzheng emperor was recalled to beijing from his military post. Yinti who expected to be placed on the throne himself was reluctant to recognise the yongzheng emperor's succession as legitimate. Yinti was accused of violating imperial decorum at the funeral proceedings of the late emperor and placed under house arrest by the yongzheng emperor at the imperial tombs in western beijing. Historians believe that their mother empress xiaogongren favoured yinti partly because she raised him herself while she did not raise the yongzheng emperor. She died less than six months after the kangxi emperor. By forcibly dispatching yinsi's party to separate locations geographically the yongzheng emperor made it extremely inconvenient for his rivals to link up and conspire against him. The yongzheng emperor publicly reprimanded yinsi in 1724 for mishandling an assignment eventually removing him from office and then sending him into house arrest. In 1725 the yongzheng emperor bestowed a hereditary marquis title on zhu zhilian a descendant of the imperial family of the ming dynasty. Later in 1750 during the reign of the yongzheng emperor's successor the qianlong emperor zhu zhiliang was posthumously honoured as "" marquis of extended grace "". The marquis title was passed on to zhu's descendants for 12 generations until the end of the qing dynasty in the early 20th century. Nian gengyao was a supporter of the yongzheng emperor long before the latter ascended the throne. In 1722 when he was recalling his brother yinti from the northwest border in xinjiang the yongzheng emperor appointed nian as the commander of the qing army in xinjiang. Seeing nian as no longer within his control the yongzheng emperor issued an imperial edict demoting nian to the position of a general of the hangzhou command. Longkodo was the commander of the militias stationed at the capital at the time of the yongzheng emperor's succession. After taking the throne the yongzheng emperor suppressed writings he deemed unfavorable to his court particularly those with an anti-manchu bias. Yue zhongqi promptly turned him in and in 1730 news of the case reached the yongzheng emperor. Highly concerned with the implications of the case the emperor had zeng jing brought to beijing for trial. The yongzheng emperor is also known for establishing a strict autocratic-style rule during his reign. The yongzheng emperor's reign saw the qing dynasty further establish itself as a powerful empire in asia. In response to the tragedy of the succession struggle during his father's reign the yongzheng emperor created a sophisticated procedure for choosing a successor. During the massive population growth in the qing dynasty and increasing demand from peasant and military populations for grain the yongzheng emperor launched a grain campaign in which he incentivized officials in local and provincial governments to compete in buying land meant specifically for farming. The yongzheng emperor offered officials 5-10 year tax holidays in which they were free from paying taxes. Ethnicity in qing dynasty could vary depending on where one was from even locally in china. The yongzheng emperor in an attempt to allow for as many people to take the civil service examination as possible set up special exams for people in rural china. The yongzheng emperor sought to remedy this by mandating that orphanages (also called poor houses) be built in every county. The kangxi emperor mandated that scholars that had passed the civil service examination at any level were able to bypass punishments from the legal system depending on which level of the exams they had passed. In an attempt to stop this the yongzheng emperor made it illegal to offer privileges to officials going through the legal system. This did not last long as the qianlong emperor reinstated legal privileges for officials that had passed the civil service examination shortly after becoming emperor after yongzheng. In the mid 1720s qing empire complex levels of tax hierarchies put in place by the kangxi emperor existed to separate the population into different tax brackets. The yongzheng emperor removed these privileged tax brackets as he saw the local gentry as competition to the throne. Just like the legal privileges that passing the civil service examination offered soon after the end of the yongzheng emperor's reign the qianlong emperor quickly reinstated the privileged tax brackets. Growing distrust of jesuit missionaries by the kangxi emperor and later yonzheng in the early 1720s led to prohibition and action against the christian presence in china. The kangxi emperor had banned foreign missions (outside of beijing and guangzhou) and yongzheng took this one step further by removing all foreign priests from china. Like his father the yongzheng emperor used military force in order to preserve the qing empire's position in outer mongolia. For the tibetan campaign the yongzheng emperor sent an army of 230,000 led by nian gengyao against the dzungars and their army of 80,000. Later in the yongzheng emperor's reign he sent a small army of 10,000 to fight the dzungars again. Following the reforms of 1729 the treasury's income increased from 32,622,421 taels in 1721 to about 60 million taels in 1730 surpassing the record set during the kangxi emperor's reign but the pacification of the qinghai area and the defence of border areas were heavy burdens on the treasury. It was because of the cost of war that the yongzheng emperor considered making peace with the dzungars. China and qing were noticeably and increasingly equated with each other during the qianlong emperor's reign with the qianlong emperor and the qing government writing poems and documents using both the chinese name zhongguo and the manchu name dulimbai gurun. Compared to the reigns of previous qing emperors such as the yongzheng and kangxi emperors the use of china to refer to the qing empire appears most during the qianlong emperor's reign according to scholars who examined documents on sino-russian relations. The yongzheng emperor spoke out against the claim by anti-qing rebels that the qing were only rulers of manchus and not china saying "" the seditious rebels claim that we are the rulers of manchus and only later penetrated central china to become its rulers. The yongzheng emperor stated : "" the lord of heaven is heaven itself. Introducing china to his religious faith was in matteo ricci's mission and he successfully built a church in 1601 at beijing also known as the forbidden city. The yongzheng emperor was firmly against christian converts among the manchus. In 1724 the yongzheng emperor issued a decree proscribing catholicism. This was followed by the persecution of chinese christians that steadily increased during the reign of the yongzheng emperor's son the qianlong emperor. The yongzheng emperor ruled the qing empire for 13 years before dying suddenly in 1735 at the age of 56. Another theory was that lü siniang was the yongzheng emperor's lover and the real mother of the qianlong emperor but he refused to let her become the empress. To prevent a succession crisis like he had faced the yongzheng emperor was said to have ordered his third son hongshi (an ally of yinsi) to commit suicide. The yongzheng emperor was interred in the western qing tombs southwest of beijing in the tailing mausoleum complex (known in manchu as the elhe munggan). His fourth son hongli then still known as "" prince bao (of the first rank) "" succeeded him as the qianlong emperor. The qianlong emperor rehabilitated many figures who had been purged during his father's reign including restoring honours to many of his uncles who were formerly his father's rivals in the succession struggle. Shortly after he was born hongli switched places with one of the yongzheng emperor's daughters was raised as the emperor's son and eventually inherited the throne. The second legend about the qianlong emperor's origins more popular in northern china stated that during a trip to the mulan hunting grounds (木 蘭 圍 場) in rehe province the yongzheng emperor had an illegitimate affair with a palace maid and they conceived a son who became the qianlong emperor. The yongzheng emperor had 14 children with his primary wife and consorts. Of these children only five hongshi hongli hongzhou hongyan and the princess huaike were known to have survived into adulthood. 18th-century chinese painting of the yongzheng emperor wearing a european wig and dress preparing to strike a tiger with a trident | alt = painting of chinese man in western clothes attacking a tiger with a pitchfork-like staff.

69	T70	TH70	H	"Charles dickens (7 february 1812 – 9 june 1870) was an english writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the victorian era. Born in portsmouth dickens left school to work in a factory when his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. Despite his lack of formal education he edited a weekly journal for 20 years wrote 15 novels five novellas hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles lectured and performed readings extensively was an indefatigable letter writer and campaigned vigorously for children's rights education and other social reforms. Dickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of the pickwick papers. His novels most published in monthly or weekly instalments pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction which became the dominant victorian mode for novel publication. For example when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way miss mowcher in david copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities dickens improved the character with positive features. His 1843 novella a christmas carol remains popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every artistic genre. Oliver twist and great expectations are also frequently adapted and like many of his novels evoke images of early victorian london. His 1859 novel a tale of two cities set in london and paris is his best-known work of historical fiction. Charles john huffam dickens was born on 7 february 1812 at 1 mile end terrace (now 393 commercial road) landport in portsea island (portsmouth) the second of eight children of elizabeth dickens (née barrow 1789 – 1863) and john dickens (1785 – 1851). He asked christopher huffam rigger to his majesty's navy gentleman and head of an established firm to act as godfather to charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for paul dombey the owner of a shipping company in dickens's novel dombey and son (1848). In january 1815 john dickens was called back to london and the family moved to norfolk street fitzrovia. When charles was four they relocated to sheerness and thence to chatham kent where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. Charles spent time outdoors but also read voraciously including the picaresque novel This period came to an end in june 1822 when john dickens was recalled to navy pay office headquarters at somerset house and the family (except for charles who stayed behind to finish his final term of work) moved to camden town in london. The family had left kent amidst rapidly mounting debts and living beyond his means john dickens was forced by his creditors into the marshalsea debtors' prison in southwark london in 1824. Charles then 12 years old boarded with elizabeth roylance a family friend at 112 college place camden town. Dickens later used the prison as a setting in little dorrit. As he recalled to john forster (from the life of charles dickens) : His name was bob fagin and i took the liberty of using his name long afterwards in oliver twist. A few months after his imprisonment john dickens's paternal grandmother elizabeth dickens died and bequeathed him £ 450. Charles's mother elizabeth dickens did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. Righteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which working-class people lived became major themes of his works and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite and most autobiographical, novel david copperfield : "" i had no advice no counsel no encouragement no consolation no assistance no support of any kind from anyone that i can call to mind as i hope to go to heaven ! "" He did not consider it to be a good school : "" much of the haphazard desultory teaching poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere are embodied in mr. creakle's establishment in david copperfield . "" This education was to inform works such as nicholas nickleby dombey and son and especially bleak house — whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of dickens's own views regarding particularly the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to "" go to law "". In 1830 dickens met his first love maria beadnell thought to have been the model for the character dora in david copperfield. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian charles mathews but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose he had set out on his career as a writer. He rented rooms at furnival's inn and worked as a political journalist reporting on parliamentary debates and he travelled across britain to cover election campaigns for the morning chronicle. Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname "" moses "" which he had given to his youngest brother augustus dickens after a character in oliver goldsmith's the vicar of wakefield. He began a friendship with william harrison ainsworth the author of the highwayman novel rookwood (1834) whose bachelor salon in harrow road had become the meeting place for a set that included daniel maclise benjamin disraeli edward bulwer-lytton and george cruikshank. The resulting story became the pickwick papers and though the first few episodes were not successful the introduction of the cockney character sam weller in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by phiz) marked a sharp climb in its popularity. In 1836 as he finished the last instalments of the pickwick papers he began writing the beginning instalments of oliver twist — writing as many as 90 pages a month — while continuing work on bentley's and also writing four plays the production of which he oversaw. Oliver twist published in 1838 became one of dickens's better known stories and was the first victorian novel with a child protagonist. On 2 april 1836 after a one-year engagement and between episodes two and three of the pickwick papers dickens married catherine dickens (1816 – 1879) the daughter of george hogarth editor of the evening chronicle. The first of their ten children charley was born in january 1837 and a few months later the family set up home in bloomsbury at 48 doughty street london (on which charles had a three-year lease at £ 80 a year) from 25 march 1837 until december 1839. Dickens's younger brother frederick dickens and catherine's 17-year-old sister mary moved in with them. His grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for the june instalment of pickwick papers and had to cancel the oliver twist instalment that month as well. His success as a novelist continued. The young queen victoria read both oliver twist and pickwick staying up until midnight to discuss them. Nicholas nickleby (1838 – 39) the old curiosity shop (184041) and finally his first historical novel barnaby rudge: a tale of the riots of 'eighty as part of the master humphrey's clock series (1840 – 41) were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books. In the midst of all his activity during this period there was discontent with his publishers and john macrone was bought off while richard bentley signed over all his rights in oliver twist. Dickens includes in notes a powerful condemnation of slavery which he had attacked as early as the pickwick papers correlating the emancipation of the poor in england with the abolition of slavery abroad citing newspaper accounts of runaway slaves disfigured by their masters. Soon after his return to england dickens began work on the first of his christmas stories a christmas carol written in 1843 which was followed by the chimes in 1844 and the cricket on the hearth in 1845. Of these a christmas carol was most popular and tapping into an old tradition did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of christmas in britain and america. This and david copperfield (1849 – 50) mark a significant artistic break in dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works. At about this time he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother augustus dickens worked (john chapman & co .). After further fraudulent activities powell fled to new york and published a book called the living authors of england with a chapter on charles dickens who was not amused by what powell had written. His son henry fielding dickens described dickens as someone who "" possessed deep religious convictions "". Dickens is an enlightened unitarian . ” writer gary colledge however asserted that he "" never strayed from his attachment to popular lay anglicanism "". Leo tolstoy and fyodor dostoyevsky referred to dickens as "" that great christian writer "". Dickens started to write david copperfield in 1848. In late november 1851 dickens moved into tavistock house where he wrote bleak house (1852 – 53) hard times (novel) (1854) and little dorrit (1856). During this period he worked closely with the novelist and playwright wilkie collins. In 1856 his income from writing allowed him to buy gads hill place in higham, kent. Dickens fell in love with one of the actresses ellen ternan and this passion was to last the rest of his life. After separating from catherine dickens undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours which together with his journalism were to absorb most of his creative energies for the next decade in which he was to write only two more novels. Major works soon followed including a tale of two cities (1859) and great expectations (1861) which were resounding successes. Since ellen ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her the extent of the affair between the two remains speculative. That the two had a son who died in infancy was alleged by dickens's daughter kate perugini whom gladys storey had interviewed before her death in 1929. Two of his sons alfred d'orsay tennyson dickens and edward dickens migrated to australia edward becoming a member of the parliament of new south wales as member for wilcannia between 1889 and 1894. On 9 june 1865 while returning from paris with ellen ternan dickens was involved in the staplehurst rail crash. He suffered a stroke on 18 april 1869 in chester. After further provincial readings were cancelled he began work on his final novel the mystery of edwin drood. Although in grave health by this time he read a christmas carol and the trial from pickwick. On 8 june 1870 dickens suffered another stroke at his home after a full day's work on edwin drood. He never regained consciousness and the next day five years to the day after the staplehurst rail crash he died at gads hill place. Biographer claire tomalin has suggested dickens was actually in peckham when he suffered the stroke and his mistress ellen ternan and her maids had him taken back to gad's hill so the public would not know the truth about their relationship. Contrary to his wish to be buried at rochester cathedral "" in an inexpensive unostentatious and strictly private manner "" he was laid to rest in the poets' corner of westminster abbey. Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist's grave stanley assured those present that "" the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the new world and the old as that of the representative of literature not of this island only but of all who speak our english tongue . "" To cite one of numerous examples the name mr. murdstone in david copperfield conjures up twin allusions to "" murder "" and stony coldness.

Many were drawn from real life : mrs nickleby is based on his mother though she didn 't recognise herself in the portrait just as mr micawber is constructed from aspects of his father's ' rhetorical exuberance ' : harold skimpole in bleak house is based on james henry leigh hunt : his wife's dwarfish chiropodist recognised herself in miss mowcher in david copperfield. David copperfield is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in bleak house reflect dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in chancery for breach of copyright. Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt and this became a common theme in many of his books with the detailed depiction of life in the marshalsea prison in little dorrit resulting from dickens's own experiences of the institution. Lucy stroughill a childhood sweetheart may have affected several of dickens's portraits of girls such as little em 'ly in david copperfield and lucie manette in a tale of two cities. Dickens's talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end. It was he who suggested that charley bates should be redeemed in oliver twist. In robert louis stevenson's novel the wrecker there is a comment by captain nares investigating an abandoned ship : "" see ! He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break like charles dickens and his serial novels . "" Dickens's second novel oliver twist (1839) shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime : it challenged middle class polemics about criminals making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed. The encyclopædia britannica online comments that despite "" patches of emotional excess "" such as the reported death of tiny tim in a christmas carol (1843) "" dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist "". In oliver twist dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (esther summerson in bleak house and amy dorrit in little dorrit) this idealism serves only to highlight dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. For example oliver twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Dickens was the most popular novelist of his time and remains one of the best-known and most-read of english authors. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the victorian era. French writer jules verne called dickens his favourite writer writing his novels "" stand alone dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression . "" Dutch painter vincent van gogh was inspired by dickens's novels in several of his paintings like vincent's chair and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading dickens especially a christmas carol was one of the things that was keeping him from committing suicide. A christmas carol is most probably his best-known story with frequent new adaptations. Novelist william makepeace thackeray called the book "" a national benefit and to every man and woman who reads it a personal kindness "". George bernard shaw even remarked that great expectations was more seditious than marx's das kapital. The exceptional popularity of dickens's novels even those with socially oppositional themes (bleak house 1853 little dorrit 1857 our mutual friend 1865) not only underscored his almost preternatural ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters but also ensured that the victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored. These include the charles dickens museum in london the historic home where he wrote oliver twist the pickwick papers and nicholas nickleby and the charles dickens birthplace museum in portsmouth the house in which he was born. In 2014 a life-size statue was unveiled near his birthplace in portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth this was supported by the author's great-great grandsons ian and gerald dickens.
